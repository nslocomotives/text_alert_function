# Contributing

We encourage any form of contribution, whether that be issues, comments, or pull requests. If you are submitting a PR, there are a few things we would appreciate that you do to keep the codebase clean:

* **Write tests.** we use[coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.3/). Any new code should not drop the test coverage (run `coverage run -m pytest arg1 arg2 arg3`).
* **Follow the linter.** We use [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/). Run `pylint main.py` before submitting a PR.
* **Ask questions if you aren't sure.** If you have any questions while implementing a fix or feature, feel free to create an issue and ask us. We're happy to help!
